# iot_garbage_mgmt
Smart Garbage Management using IoT (prototype)


Code for implementation of [this](https://medium.com/@vganesh1223/smart-garbage-management-using-iot-675c3c774bb6) article

Contains:

----------> Arduino code to be uploaded in individual dustbin modules.

----------> Python notebook to calculate the distance and plot the route.


Arduino code and the python notebook are not linked yet....
....have to find a good way to do that. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
